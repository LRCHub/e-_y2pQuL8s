[00:11.84] Slip inside the eye of your mind
[00:15.86] Don't you know you might find
[00:19.41] A better place to play
[00:23.66] You said that you'd never been
[00:27.68] But all the things that you've seen
[00:31.16] Will slowly fade away
[00:41.66] 
[00:35.36] So I start a revolution from my bed
[00:40.94] 'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
[00:46.94] Step outside, summertime's in bloom
[00:52.70] Stand up beside the fireplace
[00:55.78] Take that look from off your face
[00:58.74] You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
[01:17.74] 
[01:10.29] And so Sally can wait
[01:14.43] She knows its too late as we're walking on by
[01:21.88] Her soul slides away
[01:26.91] "But don't look back in anger" I heard you say
[01:49.91] 
[01:42.76] Take me to the place where you go
[01:46.85] Where nobody knows if it's night or day
[01:54.26] Please don't put your life in the hands
[01:58.42] Of a Rock n' Roll band
[02:01.95] Who'll throw it all away
[02:13.95] 
[02:06.13] Gonna start a revolution from my bed
[02:11.43] 'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
[02:17.64] Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
[02:38.14] 
[02:23.31] Stand up beside the fireplace
[02:26.61] Take that look from off your face
[02:29.41] 'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
[02:51.91] 
[02:41.12] And so Sally can wait
[02:45.33] She knows its too late as she's walking on by
[02:52.59] My soul slides away
[02:57.88] "But don't look back in anger" I heard you say
[03:20.88] 
[03:39.67] So Sally can wait
[03:43.95] She knows its too late as we're walking on by
[03:51.10] Her soul slides away
[03:56.33] "But don't look back in anger" I heard you say
[04:03.34] So Sally can wait
[04:07.46] She knows its too late as she's walking on by
[04:29.96] 
[04:14.79] My soul slides away
[04:20.29] "But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger"
[04:28.90] I heard you say
[04:38.09] At least not today
