[00:11.82] Slip inside the eye of your mind
[00:15.82] Don't you know you might find
[00:19.53] A better place to play
[00:23.78] You said that you'd never been
[00:27.63] But all the things that you've seen
[00:31.10] Will slowly fade away
[00:41.60] 
[00:35.42] So I start a revolution from my bed
[00:40.94] 'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
[00:46.98] Step outside, summertime's in bloom
[00:52.77] Stand up beside the fireplace
[00:55.75] Take that look from off your face
[00:58.79] You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
[01:17.79] 
[01:10.33] And so Sally can wait
[01:14.37] She knows its too late as we're walking on by
[01:21.86] Her soul slides away
[01:26.95] "But don't look back in anger" I heard you say
[01:49.95] 
[01:42.73] Take me to the place where you go
[01:46.85] Where nobody knows if it's night or day
[01:54.34] Please don't put your life in the hands
[01:58.40] Of a Rock n' Roll band
[02:01.96] Who'll throw it all away
[02:13.96] 
[02:06.17] Gonna start a revolution from my bed
[02:11.41] 'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
[02:17.68] Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
[02:38.18] 
[02:23.45] Stand up beside the fireplace
[02:26.61] Take that look from off your face
[02:29.44] 'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
[02:51.94] 
[02:41.11] And so Sally can wait
[02:45.37] She knows its too late as she's walking on by
[02:52.59] My soul slides away
[02:57.89] "But don't look back in anger" I heard you say
[03:20.89] 
[03:39.79] So Sally can wait
[03:43.92] She knows its too late as we're walking on by
[03:51.13] Her soul slides away
[03:56.48] "But don't look back in anger" I heard you say
[04:03.35] So Sally can wait
[04:07.54] She knows its too late as she's walking on by
[04:30.04] 
[04:14.70] My soul slides away
[04:20.29] "But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger"
[04:28.83] I heard you say
[04:38.08] At least not today
